## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Slidecrafting book
The contents from this slide deck are written in markdown. The tips and tricks almost all come from <https://slidecrafting-book.com>


::: {.section-slide .red-bg}
# Section Title
A strong section divider slide
:::

## Regular content again

Clean, off-white background and dark text.

+ First key message
+ Second key message with a bit more text
    + Nested detail one
    + Nested detail two
+ Third key message

## Another slide

[Inline]{.red} accents work [very easily]{.green} with text styling from a `.scss` file.

Because it's markdown, equations are also easy to include as inline, eg $E = mc^2$ or seperated:

$$ E = mc^2 $$

Like that one.

# Now I'm green
Section titles can change colour by section...

## Miles per Gallon vs Horsepower

Code chunks can incude plots. 

```{r}

library(ggplot2)

ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = hp, y = mpg)) +
  geom_point(color = "#e83f35", size = 3, alpha = 0.8) +        # brand red
  geom_smooth(method = "loess", se = FALSE, color = "#003d4c",  # alt green/teal
              linewidth = 1.2, span = 0.9) +
  labs(
    title = "Fuel efficiency declines with horsepower",
    subtitle = "mtcars (n = 32)",
    x = "Horsepower",
    y = "Miles per gallon"
  ) +
  theme_minimal(base_family = "Roboto") +
  theme(
    plot.background = element_rect(fill = "#fefefe", color = NA),  # off-white
    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),
    axis.title = element_text(color = "#2f2f2f"),
    axis.text = element_text(color = "#2f2f2f"),
    plot.title = element_text(face = "bold", color = "#2f2f2f"),
    plot.subtitle = element_text(color = "#2f2f2f")
  )
```
